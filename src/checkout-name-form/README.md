# checkout-name-form

A N3O Package for use in client websites.

Provides the Name component for use as part of website checkouts.

Can be rendered in `horizontal` and `vertical` layouts.

Examples of both layouts are provided in this repo. Run `npm run serve` to run the example code.

### Usage

As with all n3o frontend packages, install the package in the JS directory of the given client project.

```shell script
npm install @n3o/checkout-name-form
```

### Basic Use


### Styling

Lit creates a Shadow DOM for each web component that is rendered within the document.

As such, developers do not have full control over shadow DOM styling from the outside.

Styles can be configured by setting CSS variables. Full list of CSS variables which may be configured for this component are listed in the demo code in `index.html`.

Additional variables can easily be added, please contact the project authors or open a PR.
